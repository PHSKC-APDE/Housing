Title: Organizes public housing authority data into a longitudinal record
Description: LARGELY FOR INTERNAL USE
  Takes raw public housing authority extracts (specific to Seattle Housing
  Authority and King County Housing Authority currently) and merges them into a
  single, deduplicated, longitudinal record.
  Can also link the longitudinal data to Medicaid claims data (which
  will already be processed and stored in a given format).
