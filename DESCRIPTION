Title: Organizes public housing authority data into a longitudinal record
Description: LARGELY FOR INTERNAL USE
  Takes raw public housing authority extracts (specific to Seattle Housing Authority and King County Housing Authority currently)
  and merges them into a single, deduplicated, longitudinal record. Can also link the longitudinal data to Medicaid claims data (which
  will already be processed and stored in a given format)
