\usage{
count_chronic(
  df_chronic = chronic,
  df_pop = chronic_pop,
  condition = NULL,
  year = 22
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_chronic}{A data frame containing chronic condition data with 
person IDs, condition indicators, and date ranges (from_date, to_date).}

\item{df_pop}{A data frame containing population data with demographic and 
housing characteristics. Default is chronic_pop.}

\item{condition}{The chronic condition of interest. Should match a field name 
in df_chronic (typically a binary indicator).}

\item{year}{The calendar year (2 digits) of interest. Default is 22 (for 2022).}
}
\value{
A data frame with counts of people with the chronic condition, 
grouped by year and various demographic/housing characteristics including 
agency, enrollment type, dual eligibility, age group, gender, ethnicity, 
voucher status, subsidy type, operator, portfolio, length of housing, and ZIP code.
}
\description{
This function counts the number of people with chronic conditions for a given 
calendar year. It is currently specific to the joined Medicaid/housing data 
sets but could be generalized to other data. The function joins condition 
data with population data to create comprehensive counts across demographic 
and housing characteristics.
